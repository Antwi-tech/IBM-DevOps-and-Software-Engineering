Devops is changing society the problem is how the society adapts to the organisational 
changes 
It adapts lean and agile methods to develop 

Think differently, work differently, organise differently, measure differently

Team culture makes a large difference to a team's ability to deliver software and meet
or exceed their organisational goals - Accelerate State of Devops 2021

Build team work, accountability and trust , discipline

Technology is the enabler of innovation
Fail fast but roll back quickly

The term development and operations is an extension of agile development 
environment that aims to enhance the process of software delivery as a whole- Pratrick Debois

DevOps is a cultural change in which development and operations engineers work 
together during the entire development cycle

Characteristics of develops 

Agility - DevOps + Microservices + Contianers 
Devops: cultural change , automated pipeline, IaC, immutable infrastructure 
Microservices: Loose coupling/binding, Restful api, design to resist failures , test by 
breaking 
Contianers: Portability, Developer centric, Ecosystem enabler, fast startup 

DevOps starts with learning how to work differently. It embraces cross-functional teams
with openness, transparency and respect as pillars - Tony Stafford , Shadow Soft

DEVOPS 3 DIMENSIONS
- culture
- methods
- tools

Culture is the #1 success factor in DevOps . Building a culture of shared responsibility
, transparency and faster feedback is the foundation of every high-performing 
DevOps team- Atlassian 

Waterfall Method 
Architecture -> Developemt -> Testing -> operations or
Requirements -> Design -> Code -> Integrate -> Test -> Deploy
This could take like 2 years before software release which is long

At this point in the course, you know: 

Technology is the enabler of innovation, rather than the driver of innovation. You must have an innovative business idea to leverage technology.

In 2009, John Allspaw described an innovative approach to managing development and operations that enabled Flickr to complete over ten deploys per day, when many companies were completing fewer than one deploy every six months. This was a key moment in the growth of DevOps.

DevOps is the practice of development and operation engineers working together during the entire development lifecycle, following Lean and Agile principles that allow them to deliver software in a rapid and continuous manner.

DevOps is not it is not just Dev and Ops working together. It is a cultural change and a different way to work. DevOps has three dimensions: culture, methods, and tools. Of these, culture is the most important. 

The essential characteristics of DevOps include cultural change, automated pipelines, infrastructure as code, immutable infrastructure, cloud native application design, the ecosystem of containers, and how to deploy with immutable infrastructure.

DevOps started in 2007 when Patrick Debois and Andrew Clay Shafer began to gather like-minded people together at conferences to talk about common experiences.

In 2009, Allspaw delivered his now famous “10+ Deploys Per Day – Dev and Ops Cooperation at Flickr” presentation and the idea gained ground. Also in 2009, Patrick Debois started a conference called DevOpsDays that helped spread the DevOps message.

Books such as Continuous Delivery in 2010, The Phoenix Project in 2013, and The DevOps Handbook in 2016, helped practitioners understand how DevOps worked.

The major influential people of the early DevOps movement: Patrick Debois, Andrew Clay Shafer, John Allspaw, Jez Humble, Gene Kim, John Willis, Bridget Kromhout, and Nicole Forsgren, went out and made a difference, showing the results that could be achieved with DevOps.

The message spread from practitioner to practitioner until they began to realize what was possible with DevOps and that it was a better way to work.
